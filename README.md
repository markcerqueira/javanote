# javanote
A Hello World Java project integrated with the Evernote SDK

1\. Download this project to your computer by clicking Download ZIP on the main [GitHub page][1] or downloading directly [here][2].

2\. Create an Evernote account on the [sandbox environment][3]. This user will be SEPARATE from your main Evernote user that runs on the production environment. Sandbox accounts are much easier to integrate with the Evernote API and your data will be safer from your code as well! :) 

3\. Visit [https://sandbox.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action][4] to create a Developer Token. Do not share this as it gives anyone who knows how to use the Evernote API access to read and modify your account!

4\. Copy our Developer Token into the top of Main.java in the String variable DEVELOPER_TOKEN. If you want to run the EDAMDemo you can also paste your Developer Token into the AUTH_TOKEN variable.
